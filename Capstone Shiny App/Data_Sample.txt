4. Finally, we believe that additional legislation can help address this problem. The Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, passed in 2009, makes it easier for women to recover back wages when they discover long-term wage discrimination. The Paycheck Fairness Act, first introduced in 2009, would require employers to demonstrate that wage discrepancies are based on actual job distinctions, protect employees from being fired for discussing their pay with colleagues, prohibit employers from engaging in retribution against workers who raise issues of pay parity, and provide for additional research into the causes of this intransigent problem.

Others, like a boisterous version of "Glad All Over" by the Dave Clark Five, flashed a rare glimpse of Bon Jovi the pop geek. Only deep into the set did he turned his attention to his own material, performing hits such as "Prayer," "Wanted Dead or Alive" and "You Give Love a Bad Name."

Shrinking or consolidating would raise concerns about how to transfer that power to borrow money, resolve labor contracts and smooth over cultural differences between agencies — "right down to the way we painted our trucks," said Tim McDonough, who was leading the New Jersey Highway Authority, which ran the Garden State Parkway, when it merged with the Turnpike Authority in 2003. He said the merger "was not easy" but saved money on equipment, purchasing and management costs.

The lease proposal includes Obama administration measures designed to encourage oil and gas exploration companies to develop the leases. The Interior Department has increased the minimum bid for deepwater leases to $100 an acre from $37.50. Administration officials said Wednesday that the increase was designed to give leaseholders incentives to invest in acreage they would be more likely to explore. Escalating rental rates are also designed to encourage faster exploration and development.

Paul Schurick, 55, testified that Ehrlich needed more — not fewer — crossover African-American voters to boost his 2010 candidacy. He said that during a July meeting, he rejected political consultant Julius Henson's strategy — laid out in what Henson called the "Schurick Doctrine" — to keep those votes down. When Henson raised the idea again soon after, Schurick said he reiterated his position that the ploy was "completely unacceptable."
This is in response to "Senior shame." We'll start off with, that I'm one of them that you talked about. I started out with four years in the United States Navy in World War II. I went on Social Security approximately 14 years ago, and I still receive Social Security now. I started paying Social Security in 1940. When I retired in 1990, I started receiving the Social Security pay. I earned it, I paid for it. I earned it by fighting for my country, and I paid for it for working for my country.
"(The downtown proposal) would not have required any upfront payment by the Kings' ownership," NBA Commissioner David Stern reiterated Friday. "It was all the city ($255 million), AEG ($58 million) and the NBA (loan of $67 million plus a $7 million gift). Both loan and subsidy. All the parties stretched as far as they could."
The administration and many in Congress seem to view defense as an easy target for across-the-board reductions. Gates is waging his final war against such abstraction. Decisions on defense spending, in his view, must be based on strategy, not on budget mathematics. "Right now, the process is just the reverse," he argues. "Everybody's doing math and not strategy."

One thing he didn't mention: The film's near-total reliance on the stories of bullying among impoverished and lower-middle-class students in small towns in the South and Midwest. Set in Georgia, Iowa, Texas, Mississippi and Oklahoma, the film's lack of context outside those settings makes bullying appear to be a rural and lower-class problem.

Over 90 percent of the emissions causing smog came from mobile sources and more than half of that could be attributed to diesel-fueled vehicles, according to the report. But some of the county's air quality troubles can be attributed to pollutants coming from Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside counties and to a lesser extent from Mexico, the report noted.
The proposed "fracking" rules also set standards for proper construction of wells and wastewater disposal.

The sexual counterrevolution represents a minority view in American democracy. Today, a solid majority of Americans support abortion rights, gay civil rights and other socially liberal positions; by a 2-to-1 or 3-to-1 margin, Americans oppose the extreme positions staked out by the right-wing sexual counterrevolutionaries on abortion and gay civil rights. Even on gay marriage, the balance has shifted toward more liberty and acceptance.

"The Girl Who Played With Fire," which was directed by Daniel Alfredson from a screenplay by Jonas Frykberg, doesn't have the nuances of its predecessor. It's more of a straight-ahead action saga, although straight ahead is a better description of the hurtling pace than the convoluted plot, which takes all sorts of twists and turns in the present while delving further into the tortured past of its heroine, Lisbeth Salander. If you're resistant to extravagant melodrama, or flat-out horror tropes, you may find the film inferior to "Dragon Tattoo." For my own part, I confess to enjoying the lurid stuff just as much as the dramatic intricacies that reflect the texture of the source. (At least some of the texture; what's decreasingly present in the screen adaptations is Mr. Larsson's moral outrage at what he saw as modern society's pervasive corruption.)

Crawford on Wednesday played more freely but still had mixed results. He had 22 points, but needed to take 22 shots.

Ian Stuart already knows all about Padua from his older sister Margo, who is a junior at the school, so he doesn't have to shadow anyone there. He did follow a student at St. Ignatius a few weeks ago, but he comes away with only two overwhelming feelings: That the cafeteria is the best he's seen anywhere -- "It's like a mall!" he says -- and that it just doesn't feel like the right fit for him.

Fortunately for non-digital music fans, we can still find equipment to play our big old records.

And sounds groovy.
Lawyers for the church and priests say they cannot comment because of a judge's order.

“Tom is a terrific, terrific coach who does a lot of things very well, but one of the very best things he does is pace our team, knowing when to put the pedal to the metal and when to back off,” Forman said. “I think he’s shown that with how he’s paced our team the last couple of years — when is the time to go hard in practice, when is the time not to go hard and when it’s time to give guys days off. To me, it’s one of the biggest strengths he has as a coach.”

Tiny Café Marika was another treat in 2011, whether I sat outside for lunch or, when lucky enough, snagged one of five tables inside.

In fact, it's Kentucky's Anthony Davis who took player of the year awards from The Associated Press and college basketball writers Friday.

• If you're planting vegetables, annuals or perennials in-ground, remove weeds and large rocks. Work up the soil until it's loose so air and water can reach the roots. Our mostly clay-like soil is remedied by adding homemade or store bought compost. Then mix in a slow-release fertilizer based on the size of your planting area.

NCAA at-large bids go only reluctantly to mid-majors. The programs that have invested in "infrastructure" -- facilities and coaching staffs -- get most of those bids. In the last five years, only 32 mid-majors have received at-large bids. Xavier and Brigham Young have snapped up five each. That leaves 22 for the roughly 250 other schools.

Reuse was a big issue for landscape architect Michael Painter and his wife, Sue, also Mill Valley residents. They've lived in their hillside home since 1964.

Every bit of it stayed on-site. The paving isn't mortared, so we can modify it."

With his relentless emphasis on pacing, Fiennes’ film loses something of the classic’s depth and power; events that should unfold gradually seem to spring to life within moments.

If you want legislators who spend more time with constituents, I have a better idea. Rethink the size of the Legislature. With the 2010 redistricting, 80 Assembly members each represent 465,674 people, a nearly impossible task; 40 Senate members each represent 931,349 people. The size of the Legislature hasn't changed since 1879, when the state had fewer than 1 million people.

Not likely, its critics say. For one thing, mortgage rates have already dipped to record lows without reviving the housing market, reducing high unemployment or stimulating much growth.

The first year, Parker said, he was a terrible teacher. He could relate to the kids, but he had no sense of how to manage a classroom, and he would let his emotions and temper get the better of him.

So, for example, a large minority of Americans continues to believe the president to be a Kenyan-born Muslim, despite the fact that there is not a shred of evidence to support that dumbbell theory. And they don't care. When have the fringes ever needed evidence? That's why they are the fringes.
When I discovered that the East Coast brigade had been working on this theme, I figured it was time for our homegrown bartenders to get in on the act. You want 'hood drinks? We got neighborhoods. And we got bartenders, too.

I used to know a guy who would drive up to Santa Barbara just for the afternoon to visit with an old man he respected. I couldn't believe it.

Frankly, we've always found the 35 percent recovery rate a foolish benchmark. It's mostly a sop to rural lawmakers who opposed city transit projects a generation ago. Such bean-counting fails to consider the social good that even a little-used transit line does if it connects a poor and isolated community to jobs and basic services.
When you really care about a team, it becomes more than players in a game. They become symbols for what is good in the world, people you can count on. I've now realized that individual players come and go, but the things they represent will endure.

Le Carré, whose real name is David Cornwell, did indeed work for MI5 and MI6 in the 1950s and 1960s, and his stories have always come with a ballast of realism and authenticity. His real qualities as a writer, though, lie in a gift for plot and a zest for atmosphere. When Smiley goes to Oxford to meet an old friend, researcher Connie Sachs, both scene and character leap from the page within a few sentences. "She was a big woman, bigger than Smiley by a head. A tangle of white hair framed her sprawling face. She wore a jacket like a blazer and trousers with elastic at the waist and she had a low belly like an old man's. A coke fire smoldered in the grate. Cats lay before it and a mangy grey spaniel, too fat to move, lounged on the divan. On a trolley were the tins she ate from and the bottles she drank from."
"We wanted somebody who could bring a strong conservative voice to the page, somebody readers would know and be interested to hear" from, Green said. "I don't think there's anybody who fits that in Maryland better than Bob Ehrlich does."
Why is this occurring? What has changed in the three requirements to start and grow medical device companies -- product ideas, money and employees -- to turn Minnesota's growth industry into a decliner?

2. Teresa Jacobs, Orange County mayor (Last year: 2nd). She almost topped the list. In fact, this was the closest race for the top spot we've ever seen. Jacobs, 54, is viewed as fearless, determined and careful with the public's money. If there's a reason she's not No. 1, it's because her vision remains unclear. We knew Buddy Dyer craved a new skyline. What does Jacobs want? One panelist summed Jacobs up like this: "It seems like she says 'no' more than 'yes.' But she sets the standard for accountability in local government."

If you look at the recession that we went into, we went into it in 2008. Why? Because of a huge spike in energy prices. Now you read on the front page of the paper that energy prices are going up again, and now there's this headwind to the growing economy as we've seen repeatedly as this economy has tried to recover. And yet we have vast resources of resources in this country. And we have a president who is doing everything he can to see the oil and gas, coal in this country as a liability, not an asset. Something that should be kept in the ground to protect you instead of taken out of the ground to enrich you.

These include Abdul, an undersized adolescent and sole earner for his parents and eight siblings, a boy with no illusions he will ever be more than a garbage sorter. And why should he be? He is tops in Annawadi, able to quickly divide the "empty water and whiskey bottles, mildewed newspapers, used tampon applicators" and other detritus into 60 piles, commodities he sells at a profit of $11 a day. This makes his family wealthy by the standards of Annawadi, where "only six of the slum's three thousand residents had permanent jobs"; where others ate rats and weeds, though these, too, Boo writes, "made an inestimable contribution to their neighbors. They gave those slumdwellers who didn't fry rats and eat weeds, like Abdul, a felt sense of their upward mobility."

Producing, refining and burning oil is a dirty business. It spoils our waterways with disastrous spills and poisons the air that Maryland families breathe. This summer, Exxon was responsible for spilling 42,000 gallons of oil into the Yellowstone River, a source of beauty and inspiration for the entire country. Last summer, BP's rig explosion caused the worst oil spill in our nation's history. It's about time we stop wasting taxpayer money on these reckless corporations and start taking steps toward getting off oil.
The city declined to renew the group's downtown encampment permit on Wednesday, a denial planned before the bridge plot arrests were announced Monday, said Ken Silliman, chief of staff to Mayor Frank Jackson. The group, which remained by its encampment tent Wednesday night despite a 5 p.m. deadline to leave, can still gather at a spot across the street day or night. Police are monitoring, but no arrests have been made.
This game was won, Kelly said, because "we put Stanford in a place they hadn't been this year. They'd taken big leads in all their games, which enabled them to be very methodical on their drives, line up in some exotic formations. We took them out of their rhythm a little bit."

The former, which reopened earlier this year after an extended hiatus, is open weekend evenings, where traditional live Greek music is featured. The latter is a small tiki bar known for serving kava, hookahs, and yes, a 100-ounce margarita. The drinks here are wine-based, but don't be fooled — they're potent. Expect to get roped into doing some karaoke if you stop by; just please don't butcher Whiskey in the Jar as badly as I did.
But McCoy seemed coherent in answering questions and accurately described the interception. By the time the team arrived in Berea -- about 2 a.m. -- McCoy was woozy enough that teammate Evan Moore had to drive him home. By Friday morning, he drove himself to the Berea facility for further exams and was diagnosed with a concussion. By then, he couldn't remember much about the end of the game.

SUPPORTING ACTOR IN A DRAMA SERIES
Gov.Martin O'Malley's proposal for a 6 percent sales tax on gas is a bad idea. With the current 23.5 cents per gallon tax, consumers are already struggling to make ends meet. When a Maryland citizen doesn't have enough money to pay his bills, he is forced to cut his spending and adjust his budget. As steward of the public treasury, the same standard should be applied to our governor.
GM was intentional in dropping the reality check about North American profits, Chief Financial Officer Dan Ammann said. Better to share the news now than underperform expectations later.

I was surprised to read that Gov.Martin O'Malleyis now concerned about bridge and highway safety ("O'Malley to make case for increase in gas tax," March 14). He certainly wasn't concerned when he and the legislature were robbing the transportation fund for other unfunded items.

Painting in this year's show is particularly strong, with powerful examples including Andy Hunt's "Icon II," a wall-size canvas in oil and gold leaf that reinterprets the face of a beautiful young starlet by slicing it into geometric fragments and rearranging it, Cubist-style.

The country that has most completely instituted a decriminalization regime is Portugal, which on July 1, 2001, decriminalized all drugs, including cocaine and heroin.

In San Jose, as in San Francisco, homeless populations have boomed and municipal services have shrunk. Private donations are lower than in the more famous San Francisco, where most of the national media attention is focused; South Bay city and county officials spend long days recruiting corporate donations and applying for federal and state grants. They are painfully aware when elements of their tax base disappear -- businesses moving to Livermore, Sacramento and Mexico; residents taking their spending dollars to new homes in Gilroy, Hollister and Salinas.

I repeat: I could hear the cheer in my father's voice. Now, that was something. As a rule, Dad didn't do cheer. He was one of those speak-softly-and-drive-a-big-truck kind of guys. But that day, he was downright giddy.
White: Without oak, Chardonnay can telegraph all the pretty tree-fruit flavors of fall. Seeing as we'll soon be awash in oysters and fresh Dungeness, I wanted a mineral edge too. (Plus, the prospect of an oaky white to match turkey seems like a turbo booster for your tryptophan-induced haze.) The 2010 vintage once again brought Chablis its stony edge, and I went with the 2010 Patrick Piuze Petit Chablis ($20, 12.5%, Aliane Wines) from an ascendant name in the region.

“Playing would give him a great platform. That’s one of the things I did talk about with him,” Dungy said. “I can go some place to a community center and talk to kids and they think of me as a coach, but when somebody like Plax or Michael talks to them, they see a peer. And for him to say something as an NFL player, it’s going to carry a lot of weight. So I’m hoping the Lord does give him that opportunity to play again because I think it will increase his platform.”

Salih threw a large bowl of warm water over my head for the rinse. He did this a couple of times.
When he was 15, the family moved to Washington state, where rents were cheaper and jobs more plentiful. His tall, lightly freckled good looks landed him a job as a greeter at an Abercrombie & Fitch store. He moved into a studio apartment and decorated it with a poster of his hero, Michael Jordan. He took two restaurant jobs to pay the bills; work pressures forced him to drop out of Pasco High School a few months short of graduation.

The Park Service faced similar questions in 1995, when it decided to bring wolves back to Yellowstone, but they were far less complicated, Smith said. Wolves had historically roamed Yellowstone until people exterminated them, resulting in an elk population that ran rampant. Bringing them back restored a balance that humans had destroyed.

The death of Whitney Houston over the weekend is still being investigated, and it might take weeks to get toxicology reports back, the Los Angeles County Coroner’s office said. That’s not an unusual time frame for such a case, but why does it take so long?
Beyond privacy and safety—Ms. Dethlefs's chief worries—there are maintenance issues, such as how to keep so much glass spotless.

"Hello, Dolly!" is a big musical and the Audrey Herman Spotlighters Theatre is small. Its in-the-round stage is only 13-by-16-feet, so the current production spills over into every available corner and aisle. It's still a tight fit, but the advantage is that this show set, in New York and Yonkers in the 1890s, is taking place all around you.
Limas has been cooperative and has talked to investigators but has not provided the location of the children's bodies, he said. Authorities would not say whether he had confessed.

I do not know all the players or circumstances in this current pre-school education standards and funding debate. On the other hand, I believe that I do know (if ever so slightly) Ms. Cunningham, and if it is Ms. Cunningham who is "determining what's quality and what's not," she seems absolutely fine with a "monopoly," but if it is someone else doing the "determining," not so much.

Meanwhile I was off to work at a church. Not just any church, mind you. A church filled with Believers, including a family I met when I was 8 years old. A family who's chance meeting led to my career as an ASL interpreter; a family who's faith inspired me deeply and wholly through my life. A family who asked me how I was and anticipated an honest answer. So I gave them one: I am done, spent, empty. I cannot carry this burden one more day. So we prayed, the whole of the congregation prayed my honesttogod prayer with me: Let it end. Soon.

But it turns out that this babysitting job was much more fun than I expected. What we arranged was for me to bring the kids up to Mohonk so we could enjoy the fun. First we went ice skating, and then we took a walk around the lake. finally, we ended the day with tea and cookies in the hotel.
Confession. I love Vogue Living. I really do. It's the Sydney Opera House of interior design magazines: surprising, refined, a little edgy (I love the way it always curves off in unexpected but joyous directions) and distinctly Australian. It also has a cheeky spirit wrapped inside that taut, dignified body. You could almost say it's the Hugh Jackman of glossies, but let's clear the screen of magazine analogies now.

A couple of weeks ago one of the Fiskateers, posted on the message board that she was looking for some scrapbookers who would create layouts with her sketches before the date that she planned to post the sketch. Her goal was to be able to show samples of how other people used her sketch. I decided to email her as I had just done a few sketches and decided that I really like doing them. It keeps my scrapping new and different. I was getting into a rut with how my pages were layed out. Now I am using different layouts and more patterned paper. Hoping that doing the sketchs helps me out in several ways.
There are a couple of stories that go with this recipe, not to mention the fact that it is one of my family's faves and one of my brothers fall down on the floor and moan if you put peanut butter and honey on a warm slice (honey first folks) let it soak into that warm bread and then the JIF peanut butter. JIF is truly the best. I should mention here, day old banana bread out of the fridge toasts brilliantly! I just like butter on mine. Everyone else uses honey and peanut butter.

Regrettable but true: there is only one American context for the idea of a North/South divide, and it always involves the Civil War. But I’m not going to talk about this 1985 series, nor am I going to talk about Patrick Swayze.
I'm entering this card in a few challenges! Rusty at Oozaks (my favorite place to buy Copics) started a blog with challenges. The very first challenge is an Oozak "Anything Goes" challenge so since I colored my little girl up w/ Copics, I'm going to give it a whirl.

Second, television and films. Need I say more? I think we’ve all noticed that best sellers read like they’ve been written to be made into an action/thriller movie. And if they are, then they’re actually composed with different elements in mind than a writer puts into a story made for reading only.
A harsh reality in querying is that you have but a few pages to grip the agent with your opening. Sometimes you have less, only a few paragraphs to captivate your audience. This may seem severe, but if you go to buy a book, and the first few pages leave you yawning or confused as to what the story is about, are you really going to purchase it?

There had been racial battles in 1870s and 1911 in Cardiff with the Chinese community but those of 1919 caused five deaths and serious injuries. Whole areas were cordoned off by the police and hundreds taken into protective custody. The Times reported the Cardiff battle: “Racial riots of a grave character occurred at Cardiff during the early hours of yesterday morning. The trouble seems to have broken out simultaneously in several adjacent parts of the city about midnight. A young man named Harold Smart walked up to a constable and complained that a coloured man had cut his throat”
I’m one of those blokes fortunate enough to be present at the birth of each of his three children. Actually, it’s not as difficult as some people make out. I don’t have any issues with the inconvenience, the stress and all that pain – as long as it’s not happening to me. But it is an experience I’ll never forget, and one which I thought I’d never repeat.
You can kind of see the buttons up the side. They're plain white ones from my favourite button op shop. Buttons are pretty much the only thing I ever find there, but they always have a good selection.
Preheat oven to 320 degrees. Spread the walnut halves on a rimmed baking sheet and toast in the oven for 7-10 minutes, just until they are golden and fragrant. Let walnuts cool slightly, then coarsely chop. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a large bowl, whisk the confectioners’ sugar with the cocoa powder and salt. Add the egg whites, vanilla and Tabasco and stir just until the batter is moistened (do not overbeat). Fold in the walnuts and cacao nibs using a spatula. Spoon a heaping teaspoon of batter onto the baking sheets and bake for 15 minutes, until the tops are glossy and lightly cracked. Let cookies cool then peel off the parchment paper.
The recipe did suggest that it took a little effort and I would agree. Mostly the filling took the most time and I don’t have a very big star nozzle for my piping bag so the piping also took a while. Other than that, on their own they were really easy to make. Recipe in May’s Olive magazine and I’m sure will be on Good Food website soon (it’s too long to write here!).

In the end, I developed a technique which I call 'poopee'. Essentially, you poo just like you'd pee - from a distance, aiming into the bowl, firing an arc of feculence through the air to its target. Given the fact that I was, more or less, pissing out of my arse, this was quite simple.

The problem with looking to another human to complete us is that, (spiritually speaking) it’s idolatry. We are to find our fulfillment and purpose in God . . . and if we expect our spouse to be ‘God’ to us, he or she will fail every day. No person can live up to such expectations.

years to come. The national cowherd is down to its lowest level since 1958, corn prices remain double to triple as high as they were in 2005, and feedlot numbers are rising because of high export demand. USDA announced placements for July were up over 56% for Texas and 76% higher in Oklahoma. These are huge numbers, and the outlook of high numbers will continue to increase for some time.
After I fueled up with breakfasty goodness I spent the entire stimulus plan on pre-Mexico things: yoga gear from Lucy, haircut at New Vintage Beauty Lounge (I like them because my friend from the summer splash swim team who I've known for 15+ years did my hair, and because they have antlers on the walls like my living room) and $80 worth of hair products that make my head smell magnificent. Tomorrow I need to get some new flip flops and return an impulse buy from The North Face (I bought another white jacket, after buying 3 jackets at Lucy. I need help.)

Just for “shits and giggles” I went to urbandictionary.com to see what the public listed as a “drama queen” The one that fits my mood today was “Someone who does not stop until you react. Someone who feeds off of attention. Instigating fights and/or arguments is what brings them peace and they usually know just what to say in order to bring these about.” These are the people who LIVE to piss you off. These psychological and spiritual leeches feed off of your attention, and leave you drained when the conversation is over. They are not looking to change…they always backpedal to the safe sentence “This is me…and if people cannot handle that, then fuck em” But these are the same ones who NEED that type of attention to survive, and the moment your attention turns elsewhere, they find ways to drag you back into their circle. Are they bad people? No. They just have bad traits. they may suffer from mental illnesses, be bipolar, high anxiety…whatever the hell floats your boat. Nevertheless, they exist, and we will have to deal with them in our lives…trust…they won’t die off in some weird natural disaster.

Oh..and you can blame it on the mistakes that I made in the last couple of years that we were together…tell yourself and anyone else who will listen that I “cheated” on you. But, you and I both know that all of these things were always there…and began from the very first year of our marriage, then progressively got worse. All I did was give you the justification to do what you had already been doing. I never cheated on you…I did have an emotional affair, that’s true. I know that hurt you, and I wish I hadn’t hurt you, but, the truth is, I just felt so alone….and I didn’t trust you enough to be able to talk to you, because anything I was feeling was wrong anyway….

Judy R Clark graduated from Heriot-Watt University in 2006 with a first class honours degree. Shortly after she decided to move back home, to save money and concentrate on trying to sell her work in various Scottish boutiques. As well as this, she signed up to the Highlands and Islands business course, which provided her with opportunities to attend networking events, exhibitions and arranged fashion events. During this time she met Sandra Murray MBE at a fashion exhibition and she kindly took her on as an intern for one year. Still striving for bigger and better, Judy applied for countless internships with Alexander McQueen and Vivienne Westwood and after many rejections she was accepted to Alexander McQueen, when her idea to illustrate the bottom of her CV attracted their attention. Judy commented that her internship with McQueen taught her primarily how to run a successful studio, how to co-ordinate people and work as part of a team.

I don’t expect Topps Company to stay silent for too long. Remember, it took just minutes after stealing Ken Griffey Jr. from Upper Deck for Topps to release mock-ups of their first cards of “The Kid”.

Colossians 2:10 informs every believer that he is complete in Christ, and what makes us so? The Holy Spirit and His work of baptising us into Christ according to 1 Corinthians 12:13. “For by one Spirit are we all baptised into one body.” There is the truth of God’s Word, as authoritative as God Himself. Again I ask, “Do you take God at His word or do you try to reason with Him.”

Hundreds of thousands of people thronged the capital Kuala Lumpur to participate in Bersih 3.0, peaceful sit-in by accessing various routes, as early as the night before the historic day, in a bid to bypass the roadblocks or any other form of “preventative” attempt taken by the authorities.
The ANC regime promptly instituted a commission of inquiry, which predictably concluded that all universities were infested by unrepentant white racists. Coloured academic Jonathan Jansen, an unapologetic critic and even hater of Afrikaners, was made rector of the university, possibly to teach those Afrikaner “racists” a lesson.
I, a peripatetic Northeastern expat living in the American Midwest, came across this recipe for chocolate-chocolate-chip cookies on a Canadian food blog. She had picked them up from an NYC food blog (or should I say the NYC food blog), who had in turn found them in a cookbook by a Francophile American, who had gotten them from a well-known Parisian chef who, apparently, came up with the original recipe. First published as Korova cookies, they are now more commonly known, at least in the food blogosphere, as World Peace Cookies for their purported ability to spread peace and harmony wherever they are baked and shared.

Heat the oil in your skillet on medium high. Add potatoes, onions, and seasoning and cook until tender. Crack eggs over the potato mix so that they look like fried eggs on top. Cook until eggs are done to desired consistency (I like mine all the way done). Add ham and spinach and cook until spinach is just withered, but heated through. You may cover this too, but I didn't need to. Everything cooks so it is like a casserole from a skillet. I didn't add any salt. It didn't need any!

So what is the LEED-PAC? Is it what it seems? Why have its listed proponents and financial backers ‘flocked together’? Do they have a stereotypical commonality, other than pure altruism? Could the LEED-PAC actually be a grouping of individuals who have vested financial or other interests in the outcomes of the coming elections, both in May and in November? One typecast observation is that the LEED-PAC is about maintaining a certain degree of control on economic development in LeeCounty; are they the so-called ‘establishment good ole boys’? Many of the LEED-PAC people have heavy financial interest in how development will transpire in the County. That doesn’t sound altruistic, rather it sounds eerily like keeping control on how money is made and who gets to make it. It also sound eerily like it entails how public tax dollars are spent, and who gets to benefit from that spending. Is the LEED-PAC a ‘Trayvon hoodie’ hiding something unknown, with unknown intent? Maybe it’s time to know just how innocent or sinister this group is. Perhaps someone will publish a column exposing just who these shadowy LEED-PAC people are and identify the businesses they run. Inquiring minds want to know.

Given Binder's deep connections he may well have heard about the UFO's interest in nuclear installations from his sources within the military and used this very silly sci-fi comic to tell this tale out of school, as it were. Why he chose to double that up with the AAT stuff is beyond me, but perhaps the Watcher/Igigi theories were being bandied about then.

I’ll probably email her right when we get back from Disney. I’ll have some cool stories to send her as well as some new pictures. And nothing’s gone on in this past month that I have a burning desire to share with her (not even going near the first father situation with a ten foot pole when it comes to my first mother). So I’m hoping the email will nearly write itself! In all actuality, I’ll probably write her an email before we leave, let it sit in my draft folder, and then delete and write a whole new one after we get back. I do a lot of that…
2) The Set Up
The author is Ruth Rendell too, of course, and it's hard to choose one from among her many outstanding books. These are always on sale in charity shops so pick any, really. I chose this one because it's set in the hot,hot summer of 1976 but ASTA'S BOOK or A DARK-ADAPTED EYE will do just as well.
The situation seems to be much the same in other parts of the social work realm. Psychiatric social workers must compete against psychiatrists and psychiatric nurses, within medical environments that can feel like foreign turf. Social workers who want to work with couples have to compete against marriage and family therapists and against counseling psych graduates, both of whom tend to get better and more specialized training because their curricula are less burdened with redundant drivel mandated by the CSWE. On the research side, there are social work faculty, teaching at the doctoral level, whose teaching abilities and subject-matter knowledge compare poorly against those of good high school math and science teachers. With prayer, doctoral students taught by these geniuses might someday succeed in proposing and conducting good research. I do believe in miracles. But where my faith fails, it is once again the poor who get screwed, as their putative rainmakers and miracle workers turn out to be frauds.

The Starting with the decision "Überwachungsvorrichtung" in 2009, the 10th senate of the German Bundespatentgericht and the BGH have develpoed a theory allowing for a re-establishment of rights even after expiry of the one-year term. The most spectacular decision "Crimpwerkzeug III" ( ZR 193/03) reported here and available (in German) here, the BGH granted re-instatement into the delay for filing new grounds of an appeal against the decision of an upper distruct court not to admit revision to the BGH because the new grounds related to contradictory claim interpretations in judgements, wherein the (binding) interpretation of the BGH was available only after the expiry of the delay.

Rob had a big bag that he carried with him at all times, almost like a woman’s purse, but this was a boating bag with lots of little pockets for all sorts of goodies he liked to have at his disposal. I’ve noted that I went through his bag October 2nd for things that the friend on the boat next door to ours had wanted. He had helped in unloading the boat of personal effects and it was his g/f who had found Rob, and they’d now decided I wasn’t their friend anymore as I wasn’t as welcoming as they were.
It's so true!

Several weeks ago I was passing snack to my children when I noticed a child crying. I ask what was wrong and several children chimed in to say the child had eaten before we said the blessing. The child, through tears, said, "I'm sorry, I forgot". I had just set the bag of crackers down on the counter. I reached over took out a couple of the bite-sized crackers and ate them. The children looked at me silently with wide eyes. I immediately placed my hand over my mouth and said, "Oh my I just ate a cracker". I continued to explain that God doesn't care when we give thanks. He only ask us to give thanks. My tearful friend was now giggling and everyone else was hushed.
Jawdat, a Muslim, was sent back to his home in Israel on Friday evening after officials in the exchange program he was enrolled in told him he had been dismissed over the incident, which occurred about a month earlier.
It is thought that James the Just was a half-brother of Jesus either through Mary and Joseph or Joseph and a previous wife. We do not know for certain. Another theory exists, whereby Joseph died, and Mary — Jesus’s mother — married Cleophas (Clophas, Mary of Clopas’s husband) and had children with him. However, this seems unlikely, as Mary of Clopas was alive when Mary the mother of Jesus was.
How can you find out what agents have sold and recent deals? Well, Publishers Marketplace is an excellent resource. Keep in mind, however, that not all agents list their sales there. So that's not the end all be all. I've actually not been announcing a lot of stuff lately for a variety of reasons.

I’m being dragged now; he’s pulling me by my hair back into the hallway. I let out a straggled moan as I reach up to grab his hands in order to ease some of the tension on my hair. I struggle a bit trying to make it harder on him, but it only makes everything hurt more so I let my body go limp, it’ll be easier this way, less pain. I look up through my swollen eye lids to look at Jack, his brown hair in disarray, hands pulling roughly at my hair as he drags me. He turns to look down at me, his eyes are empty, and he isn’t there.
seriously, all the struggle, friends calling to reserve a place in our house because we lived far from the beach. all of it for nothing.
Noted American conservative thinker Russell Kirk starts out from a premise very similar to White's but draws quite different conclusions. He finds LOTS of policy-preferences that a conservative outlook leads to. He says here:

I love that I’ve met so many wonderful people – activists, friends, authors, chefs – those who share my love for veganism but they are another bonus. I’m not vegan so I can make friends, gather fans or be part of some exclusive club. It’s NOT about my social life; it’s about the animals.
The number of road casualties amounted to 208,648 in 2010. Are we going to start blaming pregnant mothers involved in car accidents and promote publically how selfish they are for driving and not walking? I would hope not. I would hope this blame game stops and our culture of compassion returns.

It does begin with one's parents. Not only do we have DNA shepherding us behind the scenes, we all model our behaviour on the example they provide(ed). Some examples are good, of course, but many aren't and a number are downright destructive. Awareness of this helps. Out-thinking one's formative environment can lead to a better life. That's pretty much where I'm at, figuring out what my programming is - genetic and environmental - and deciding whether any of it is any good.
Before we headed to the airport (with a taxi driver that we are pretty sure was drunk no less) we got our last stores of Thai fruit. So much better than ours somehow.

Bhumika Patel explains “Sita in the Ramayana: Female Empowerment Through Trial by Fire” with a mature flourish that presided throughout her entire presentation. I was almost inspired to change my major. Though she starts off with a few…technical glitches, Bhumika manages to bravely carry on her presentation, speaking from a womanist, feminist perspective about the story of the “Ramayana”, a Sanskrit epic poem which has “stuck with her over the years”. This particular story represents the ideal man and woman for many people in South Asia. Bhumika explains that she wanted us, as her audience, to understand how woman can become inspired through this entirely patriarchal story.

About a month ago the clock on our sideboard stopped. It's the old-fashioned kind, that needs winding once a week; we bought it in an antique shop in Otford, long before we came to live in the village. It felt like bringing it home when we finally moved here.

What was once deplored by the church is now accepted. A blend of pagan rites , animism and church religion exist today. In an attempt to convert the masses the church, the Catholic church, fixed the celebrated resurrection of Jesus (Easter) around the astrological event that “spring rites” celebrate. (the full moon of the spring equinox). The fixing of Easter allows the unscriptural religious celebration of Lent and ash Wednesday to follow Mardi Gras. Instead of resisting the ways of the pagans, The “church” absorbed many of these festivals in hopes that it would convert the pagans. What we have today is a churchy world and a worldly church!!! In French, Mardi Gras means Fat Tuesday. This is a day to gorge and over indulge oneself before the seasonal religious practice of fasting, abstinence and denial. It is not surprising that the symbol for Mardi Gras is the “Bouef Gras”…… The fatten bull

By the way, we don’t really use the word “end” in this way anymore, but I’ll stick with it (you can substitute ”purpose” if you’d like, though “end” really is the more accurate term, like τέλος). Anyways, back to definitions. A subordinate end is something that one aims at, not for itself, but as a means for another end–hence, it is subordinate. For example, someone goes to the grocery store for the end of buying groceries. But buying groceries is a subordinate end, since it is not accomplished for its own sake but as a means for a greater end, to cook food and to eat. Eating may be considered an ultimate end, which is something that one aims at on its own account, for the sake of itself, for the sake of its own enjoyment. For example, eating a nice ribeye steak would be an ultimate end if it is done for its own pleasure. A chief end is the most valued in a multiplicity of ultimate ends. For example, a man drives to a nearby city for two ultimate ends: 1) to meet up with his girlfriend and spend time with her, and 2) to collect money from a friend who happens to live in the same city (for simplicity’s sake, let’s just say that collecting money is an ultimate end). These are two separate, unrelated ends from the same subordinate end (driving to the nearby city), but if the man considers spending time with his girlfriend more valuable than collecting his money, this is a chief end among the two ultimate ends, and collecting his money is the inferior end. And of course, driving to the city is a subordinate end, because it is desired as a means to accomplish other things. (Edwards also talks about supreme ends, but I’ll refer to it in a follow-up post so as to stay on track.)

Anyway! It's Queen's night tomorrow, I'll be heading out with Ruiter for a big party. We were out last week when he got a call from someone saying they were from the "Organization of the desperate pigs". He thought it was a joke at first, but it turns out that they want him to do an infographic with their data on how the welfare of farmed pigs have improved over the last decades. Ruiter says he's too damn busy, but I told him I'd help him with it, if he'd do the consulting. I'm going to try and push for it. It'll be nice to 'get out there'.

I would add that the relief can also come simply because a decision has been made and a direction has been chosen. I am not certain of the root of this false teaching historically, but it likely includes a misunderstanding of Philippians 4:6 – 7
If at a county show you are one of the judges in the section for Aberdeen Angus cattle, you will have a comprehensive list of points which must be fulfilled. There is the carriage of the creature’s head, with even teeth and broad muzzle. It should have a long body and strong legs with the joints well set. The back should be straight with a slight dip at one end. It should be well and evenly muscled with not too much fat. Viewed from behind the rump should be rounded, the legs straight and the hooves correctly positioned. When it walks its hind hoofs should enter the marks of its front hoofs without overstepping or understepping. If it is a cow its udder should not be pendulous and the teats should be of the right size and placement. If it is a bull the testicles should be large and the sheaf firmly attached and not pendulous. But all these distinctions should be weighed against the proportions of the whole animal and the aim is to assure that both it and its progeny should fulfill their

So I took his hand and dragged him out of the doorway. I saw he had a nerf gun but I didn't really know how to use them that well so I left the gun behind (which I regretted later) and I exited the room. I ran down the hall cautiously and peered around the corner. I saw a guard sleeping by another room. I ran up and quickly tapped him three times he fell dead I propped him so it looked like he was still sleeping. I peered into the room he was guarding and there was the final target BUT WTF? The room had red yarn strung across it back and forth from floor to ceiling. I was not a contortionist. Apparently if I had brought the nerf gun I could have shot the final target through the "lasers". I found out later my partner had been killed eliminating the other guards that had been roaming the halls. At that point another guard came out of the room and starting yelling alarm and I was caught - my game was over. I ended up placing 7th out of 33. Pretty good for someone who had never done it before! HA! (I think I scared my husband!)

One thing that was great about my ride was my new bike seat cover. River mentioned in the comments of my last post that she was getting chafing from her seat and needed a new one. I couldn't recommend it more! Mine is called a comfort seat and all bike shops have them. I have taken just the seat and pole to the shop before so they can put a new seat on for me. It saves taking the whole bike and is easy to get off using the quick release lever that most bikes have. Even though I was still slightly tender after riding, the actual ride was softer and more comfortable than ever. The gel seat cover wasn't cheap at $40 but my lovely lady parts think it was worth every cent!

As it happens, that book isn’t the only paranormal work of fiction that I have/had fond memories of. A few years after first reading Devi, I watched The X-Files for the first time. I think it was early 1994. I hadn’t started university yet, and came home from addabazi quite late one night. Everyone at home had gone to sleep, and I wasn’t sleepy. I switched on the TV, and saw couple of FBI agents investing some weird stuff in an Arctic scientific facility. I was hooked.

And now? The war is forgotten, all but airbrushed from our history. They’re not mentioned in Remembrance Day services, those soldiers who endured so much. Their memorials fall into decay, and the one in Beeston near Nottingham serves only to make schoolchildren giggle when they read the legend ‘Died of Diarrhoea’. No-one writes about them. Everyone here can think of several novels about Waterloo – but name just two about the Charge of the Light Brigade. Name one.

I submitted my blog article that I wrote about porn as a sort of “Let’s see what happens” kind of thing and awaited the outcome.

She looked so powerful. Like she could rule the world. I loved when she’d dive right in when we were in a crowded hotel pool—as always, she was completely oblivious and unconcerned with her surroundings, or if anyone was watching. Not that she was an expert diver or swimmer. It was the freedom in it: she plunged in and swam.

I fear the answer is yes, in a way. There was no way I was giving this proposal a rating of Excellent (the highest rating for an NSF proposal). If the proposal itself had been really well put together, showing more vision in general about the work and how to explain it, it could possibly have been in the Excellent range, but given what I saw in the proposal: no. Ignoring the fact that some of the shortcomings in understanding the proposal may have been my own, can I assume that the dense, complicated, non-linear, dry presentation of the proposed work is an indication of how the research itself will be undertaken, understood, and communicated? I decided the answer to that was also yes, and hence my overall positive but not-Excellent review.

The color is where I'm disappointed. I was under the impression that these were true neons. I know Skinny Dip isn't going to be, but I really expected that Beach Cruiser was. It's a very bright hot pink/fuchsia-ish color that's a little darker than I expected. But I'm really not seeing neon. It kinda borders between a neon and bright, but unfortunately, I just don't think it's a true neon. The other thing that gives me a hunch that it's not a true neon is it doesn't have that satin, semi-matte finish that is a trademark of a neon. I did a swatch on my nail wheel because I always top coat my polish anyway, and it looks quite shiny even without a top coat. When I picture summer neons, I picture China Glaze's Poolside collection. And don't get me wrong, this is still a BRIGHT color. I'm just still not convinced it's a neon. And also don't think that I don't like this polish. I still think it's a beautiful color. I just really expected more of a real neon.

We also have the right to purchase anything we choose in the states we travel to and not report back to our home state government. It is time the federal government cuts some of these states off as this blogger is starting to feel like I am not living in a free country at all. If my state knows, where I travel, what I purchase, and can discriminate against me at their will, that is not freedom. That my friends is not Socialism---it is Communism.

So - angel that he is - he bore with me for a whole 45 seconds while I clicked away, happy and then we were back en route, relieved, content and in the throws of a discussion about when is a picture not just a picture, and what is a good picture anyway!!

The SAIRR said if the police were truly shocked, then it suggested that "the police’s senior management is out of touch with the reality of life on the ground for people in areas such as Gugulethu who have been left to run the gauntlet of violent crime on a horrific scale".

The eyes were left misted when we heard the dolorous story of Mitu Khurrana, who comes from a very well educated family and was also married off in a family well settled and well educated. Her case impinged all souls and left everyone with an array of unanswered questions and mixed thoughts.

If the message was not understood properly, then it can only be the sender’s fault. He either constructed the message inappropriately or he failed to take into account his audience.
Isn't it ironic where arguments or bad feelings generate from sometimes? We were both just angry we haven't had much time together, and those frustrations turned into an argument. It doesn't make much sense now does it? We fought because we want to spend more time with each other? haha

I picked up Beach Cruiser and Skinny Dip from Orly's new summer neon collection Feel The Vibe at Sally's yesterday. I don't own a neon yellow or orange so I was tempted to get those, but I didn't and stuck with these two instead. Unfortunately, I'm a little disappointed in Beach Cruiser because it's really not what I expected.
Thanks to everyone who played our Gate-Fold Rebel Challenge! The ways you interpreted the format were wonderful!
On to the other hot-drink-based bargain – Pool teacups in “Blue Moon”. I found a set of 6 in an Oxfam shop for £8. I didn’t know what they were at the time, I just liked the shape. Sadly I’ve broken several of the cups and I’ve discovered that they are not cheap to replace. There’s lots of colourways including a lovely lemon yellow and a two-tone turqouise one.

‘But I dont have a passport’ – West Bengal stands to lose when it cannot appreciate the importance of that space of mental topography called East Bengal, which also is a real geographical entity. The lamentations for his long-dead mother with her spectral presence in a home he does not and cannot live but is the only place he can ever call home makes the case for the continued presence of the East Bengal in the West Bengal imagination. We do need it for sanity, to avoid a process of loss of parts of oneself. The present project of dropping the ‘West’ would help erase the memory of the grandmother altogether for the next generation, let alone lamenting the inability to return. For the next generation, there is no return may be, to the east. They are all marching to Delhi, to become ‘Indians’, a people without grandparents, but a people with an ‘ancient history’, I am told. In Delhi descend all the cosmopolitans without grandparents and great-grandparents – the first true Indians who are nothing but Indians, and powerful ones at that. Being ‘too’ Bengali or worse still, Lepcha, makes one that bit less suitable for this ‘Indianness’. This Indianness is a sophisticated shoe to fill, and I have smelly feet. Some of that smell comes as an inheritance from people who came from places where they do not even fly the Indian tri-colour.

Of convicted terrorists in Britain about 27 of 87 were trained or sought training in Pakistan or Afghanistan, Eighteen had terrorist training in Britain. Despite this, Labour’s “open door” immigration policy knowingly risked allowing dangerous people to settle in Britain unchecked, The Sunday Times reported on 8 November after secret documents were leaked. The evidence had been illegally withheld by the Home Office for four years.

I'll be honest. It's not automatic for me to see the DELIGHT in life. I've often imagined that great, blissful happiness would come with the big picture 'wins' - success, love, etc...whatever those things mean.
This, of course is a statement we are hearing more and more, as the party faithful, who have worked so feverishly to undermine our national soul, flaunt what they consider to be their victory, and seek to trump our hand with the apparent fait accompli that what they sought so hard to achieve, has come to pass.

I am behind in preparing my fleet of cars (collector or hoarder…I will leave it for the reality shows to decide) for winter duty and for others storage. The Corvette finally ran for shelter in my mother's garage (thanks mom!!!), the Electra is booked in for rust proofing next week and the storage. The Lincoln has a somewhat quieter exhaust, still needs more work, new alternator and may yet require a tune up in the form of plugs, wires, cap and rotor. Nevertheless she is moving on her own now.
The X-Men came about at a time of inequality. First published in 1962 many saw their struggle as an allegory for the racial tension in the US. Today many social groups see similarities between their struggles and the X-Men. Part of it is simply the fact that they are a bunch of teenaged mutants that just want to live in peace and be accepted for who and what they are. Teenagers tend to respond to this message the most. Bryan Singer, who directed the first two X-Men movies, said “what teenager doesn’t feel like a mutant?”

In the HOPE Court, a judge tells a probationer that instead of prison, he will be permitted to return home, where he can continue to work and provide for his family. The probationer also is told he will be called back frequently to the court without advance notice to determine whether he is complying with his probation terms. If he is not in compliance, he is placed immediately in county jail for the weekend.
Whomp Charmz Poised to become the next Sillybandz, these cute, colorful rubbery charms are also erasers. They can connect to the aforementioned bandz or clip on to laces, ear bud cords, computer cables and such. I don't recall the price, but it was reasonable for a pack of 8. I almost bought these for my son, you know, so he could be a trendsetter and all, but then I remembered the 236 silly bandz he has scattered around his bedroom and figured I'd let someone else's child have the spotlight.
I scoured the city for earplugs which apparently are a rare item because I went to every supermarket and convenience store in my neighborhood, Kmart, Target, and multiple pharmacies before I found a pair. I consulted a few people back home who actively follow F1 racing and learned about some of the drivers and made my decision of which team and driver to cheer for. I decided on team Red Bull and drivers Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber (an Aussie). They made me quite proud in the end, way to go boys!!
Dilute one hundred times,
What I found when I started reading through this little book was that rather than delivering sweet little platitudes about motherhood to encourage me, it actually challenged me. As I found myself reading all the things that "A Mother's Heart Knows", I realized that being a mother is a high calling indeed, and I am not always living up to all that God has called me to be for my children. It was AWESOME! I found myself saying things like, "Oh yes, that is so true." and "Oh, I've kind of let that slide a little." and "Wow, I really should be doing that, shouldn't I?" and "God has truly given me a gift in letting me be a mom. I need to be seeking Him more in how He'd like me to do this job!"

There is however an interrogative numerical adverb in the Greek which would have referred to frequency and it is (Posakis) and is interrupted to mean, “how many times” or “how often”. Paul did not use this word. Thus, we are not at liberty to offer the Lord’s Supper to the church at will. There is a frequency set forth in the Scriptures that we should adhere to and not deviate from.

Anyway, so far, I've only been able to leave voicemails that I'd like to make payment arrangements, so I've yet to talk to an actual person, but I'm dreading it. I understand that they provided a service for which they should be paid...for which we WANT to pay them....but seriously, you can't squeeze blood out of a turnip. I can commit to making a payment each month...but I'm guessing that I won't be able to commit to paying what they want me to pay (since they say in huge letters on the bill that payment in full is due within 30 days), and I'm kind of dreading that conversation.

In this 3 minute video Terry Moore discusses how to tie shoes the correct way. I’ve been tying my shoes for most of my life and hadn’t realized that there was actually a right and wrong way to tie shoes. It turns out that there is a best way to do this, and most people are close to getting it right but one wrong move has them tying a knot that is weak at best. This is a major cause of shoes randomly becoming untied throughout the day.

Anne Hathaway changed dresses again. This is a red dress and I like it. Her hair is again, fabulous.
You are probably thinking by now that you should have sewn the straps to the back first, so it would be easier to pin the correct length at the front - and you are totally right! That is a much easier way to do it if you are trying it on yourself. With a dress form you can do either, and with a client it is more appropriate to pin at the back.

Iona was surprised when she felt a warm weight slide over her shoulders. She looked up through her tears to see a handsome man leaning over her. It was his jacket that she found herself wrapped in. He was tall and slender, dressed in a clean white shirt. His blue eyes looked down on her, his eyebrows furrowed together in concern. “Are you alright, Miss?” came the question from his lips.

I've come to know a few things about this life, as most chicken wives do. We may be the only demographic in the world that finds it completely normal to hear our husbands talk daily about breasts, legs, and young, tender meat and answer strange phone calls in the middle of the night- all the while knowing they are in fact not cheating on us. So, how can you spot a chicken wife from the rest of the crowd?

Having determined what you think are your most pressing needs for year 1 prioritise them. Priority items you may wish to purchase in better quality (and at higher cost) than non-priority items. There may well be items that you purchase in year 1 that you will replace by year 3. For example, let’s assume you need a whole new wardrobe because you have recently lost a massive amount of weight, or vice versa. You might choose to buy some good quality shirts and a couple of cheap suits and 2 pairs of shoes in year 1 with the expectation in years 2 and 3 to give priority to building up your suit and shoe collection. In which case you don’t mind having cheap suits in year 1 because you can improve the breed as you go on. It is a 5-year project after all.

Yesterday I took two of my nephews to see The Addams Family. I LOVE musicals (Christina Bainbridge, you and I need to hang out!) but I knew nothing about the Addams Family. Yeah, I've heard of them but I've never seen the show, movie, etc. I was kinda roped into it by accident, thanks to a mistake by my MIL and I wasn't really that interested. However, I ended up being pleasantly surprised! I didn't think the music was great, but it was really funny. And it probably wasn't the most appropriate show for a 7-year old. It wasn't my idea to take him though, so you can't blame me! We did have a great time though.
How to Give the Perfect Man Hug. Hello and welcome to videojug. The modern world is a complex place for many men. You are expected to be in touch with your feminine side but never to a point which compromises your masc ulinity. And to make things even more confusing, along comes the man hug, an unabash show of affection to your fellow men. If you don’t hug, you maybe accused of not being secure in your sexuality. This isn’t the case. You’ve just never been shown exactly how to carry out the man to man hug. Watch and learn.

When she lets go of the edge of her playpen she is so proud she waves her arms in the air, chortling away, and then promptly falls. And we just have to let her do so I suppose. It's the only way she will learn. There was someone who advised me to get a helmet for her, but I can't believe that giving a toddler a helmet would do any good in the long term, either to their posture, their self confidence or their sense of common sense.

What you're asking in a query letter is if I will represent it for sale to a publisher. And the people who decide whether it's parody and fair use is NOT the author. It's the legal department at BigBucksPublishing. And those guys are paid a lot of money to keep their employer out of court.
He had a Thai waffle with peanut sauce and spiralized veggies on top. I had the Hot Mess, sourdough with veggie chorizo and pesto tofu scrambled with jalapenos. They were both fantastic and with bold flavors. We love adventurous food! Perfect for a special Sunday treat.
This bathroom will be used by guests frequently, so I took a page out of Martha Stewart’s playbook and installed a shade in the closet to conceal the upper shelves when needed. This is a great trick to use in any closet to instantly conceal clutter or an embarassing stockpile of Guns and Ammo magazines before guests arrive.

Is the race still winnable for Santorum – yes: from the New York Times: total delegates needed to win 1144, delegates remaining 1258 – Romney has 568, Santorum 273 – therefore Romney needs 576 more delegates, while Santorum requires 871, or a difference of 295 delegates separate the two competitors. With the 1258 remaining, it is not impossible for either candidate to reach the magic 1144. This is perhaps, why the left and the Romney campaign are now ramping up the attacks, looking for every possible religious reference or gaff to play to the hilt.

Here are my gloves. I bought them when I was getting a new pair of shoes last fall. I had been meaning to get thin, fingertip-less gloves for a while, so I grabbed some while I was thinking about it. Usually I don’t make impulse purchases. What’s funny is I kept reading about people getting “texting gloves” during the winter. Gloves without fingertips so people can operate their touchscreen smartphones. I would be offended if someone told me I was wearing texting gloves. I’m not one of those people who is attached to their cellphone, texting all day and all night.

So then a new ad came into rotation. "Don't you wish you could just make some things disappear?" a young woman in club wear asks, as a rat-like man with an open-to-the-sternum disco shirt seems to sniff at her from behind. She flashes him a disgusted look and he pops in a familiar cgi dust effect that sets her hair swishing playfully at the camera. She then walks toward us with swinging hips as she enumerates the virtues of the particular tampon she's trying to sell us. Across the room, a nonthreatiningly normal looking boy is being chatted up by two women you don't really see well before our off-screen heroine presumably splatters them out of existence with the sheer, horrible force of the obliteration power this new tampon has granted her. She then skips up and begins a happy conversation we can only assume he's smiling and nodding along to out of fear for not only his life, but his very physical existence.

Mom and I walked all over the French Quarter and back today, stopping for a huge breakfast at a restaurant that's been around forever called the Coffee Pot (grits and biscuits--yay!), beignets, an oyster po-boy at Acme Oyster Bar (I had the gumbo, as oysters make me say "ick"), and then shopped shopped shopped. I'm feeling a little panicky about how much money I've spent, but I've covered all the bases (kiddos, Pod, office staff, and some small stuff for me) so can consider myself "done."

The current President of Gabon Ali Bongo, son of Omar Bongo has continued the corrupt empire his father created with French politicians and the business elite. Canard Enchainé, a French satiric newspaper reported on the eve of the 2010 France-Afrique conference in Paris that Ali Bongo had purchased a hundred million euro property in Paris. The property located on the University street has been described as “one of the most beautiful” in the heart of Paris. Canard Enchainé noted that the building covers a space of 4,500 square metres with the garden covering 3,700 square metres. “The 100 million euros does not include other expenditure to be made for the renovation and maintenance work which could take a third of Gabon’s GDP”.

-All of the actors are what really make this film. The story itself is pretty standard, and often falls into rom-com clichés. But the enthusiasm of all the actors make this worth watching. Aside from Segel and Blunt, the two most interesting characters in the film were Chris Pratt (Parks & Rec) and Alison Brie (Community). NBC Thursday represent! I believe, to my memory, every line those two had in the entire film were hilarious. There were also great supporting roles from Brian Posehn, Chris Parnell (who’s always great as a broken down shell of a man), Mindy Kaling, and Kevin Hart.
I was informed by a friend earlier today that USATF CEO, Doug Logan, has sent out an invitation to athletes attending this weekends Indoor National Championships inviting them to meet with him on Friday to discuss concerns they have about the sport.

It was fascinating to see inside a private building when many of my observations are necessarily limited to the exterior only, but sometimes the guts tell us little more than the skeleton has already revealed, and that was the case here. It was time to find another way to solve the mystery.
For a year of so now I have been working on finding the perfect beer paring for this cheese but its strength in flavour and slight dry astringency has made it difficult to pair with many of the local session beers. But out of much trial and error and some success with Belgian Pale ales and strong English pale ales it seems Durham Brewery's Benedictus has proved itself as the ultimate match for this characterful local cheese.

Arcadia, California (population 56,364): La Palma City Manager Dominic Lazzaretto will become Arcadia’s next administrative chief pending City Council approval next week, according to the Pasadena Star-News. Lazzaretto, who is replacing Arcadia’s City Manager Don Penman, is expected to start on March 26. He has worked with the city of La Palma in Orange County for nine years, including six years as city manager. Lazzaretto, a Glendale resident chosen from a field of over 80 applicants, will have a base salary of $199,650 annually. Lazzaretto is also knowledgeable about public safety issues. His brother, Charles, was a Glendale police officer killed in the line of duty in 2007. La Palma was twice listed among the “Top 100 Small Cities in the United States” by Money Magazine during his tenure, according to city officials. Penman officially retired in November after nearly 14 years with the city, including four years as the city’s top administrator. He has been working as a contractor in recent months.

As advised I continued the pain killer for one more day and we were able to stay on for two more days, when at that moment our bags were packed for leaving.
Oil has continued its consolidation in the price range of about $93 and $103 per barrel. A break above this range would be very bullish, while a break below would be bearish. Which ever way this resolves, we have a nice long base to sustain a move in either direction. There is plenty of room within some widely followed indicators for prices to move up beyond $103. Consumers won’t want to hear this, but investors will be pleased. Our favorite energy investments are high dividend paying trusts, equities or index ETFs. Collecting a growing stream of dividends takes the pain that we might feel at the pump away!

I love Neil Gaiman, Clive Barker, Susan Clarke, H.P. Lovecraft. Outisde of the genre, Jonathan Franzen is a fantastic writer and I can’t get enough of Kurt Vonnegut. Ultimately though, I’m a child of Stephen King. He’s the author that first opened me up to the possibilities of storytelling. I remember sneaking The Shining from my parents room when I was a kid and being absolutely petrified by what I read. King taught me the power of words.
As eggs are invariably stored in the fridge, you can bring them to room temperature by sitting them in a bowl of hot tap water for 10 minutes. Interestingly, our habit of refrigerating eggs is not necessarily good for them – they don’t like extremes of temperature (who does?) and prefer a cool environment to a cold one. The bottom of the fridge is the safest place or an unsunny countertop.
After watching Tree of Life I was a little depressed but honestly I’m not sure why. The movie doesn’t have a traditional story and leaves everything up to the audience. It’s a hard movie to get into, and I understand that this isn’t for everybody, but I still thought visually the movie was spectacular and it’s one of the reasons why I still go to the cinema. So even though I left on a slightly depressed note I still loved the movie. This is visual poetry, it’s a movie that refreshes me from all the drivel that gets put out, and I hope Terrence Malick makes more movies like this.

Vivo offers family-style dining meaning all the plates are meant to be shared. One dish from the antipasti selection will feed two for sure, or four if you want to really stretch it. To follow the antipasti, diners are encouraged to select a dish from the primi selection. By dining this way, a pasta or risotto dish is enough to satisfy four and the secondi (entrees) can be shared by two.
I wanted to make the cookies match the baby shower invitations, so I used orange royal icing to outline half of the cookies, and blue/grey royal icing to outline the rest. It took me a while to match the blue color to the one in the invitations, but I ended up mixing in royal blue, black, and a teeny bit of purple to achieve the right shade.

Thanks to the lovely interweb, the set list from last night was posted somewhere almost immediately. Perhaps the thing to do is just amend that list with my observations? (Note: Every song not annotated should include the default statement "I was totally blissed out when they played THAT one.")

I guess it's become popular these past few years to say that people won't attend conferences because they can meet in the Gopher Chat Rooms and on MySpace, or whatever the kids are into now. You can twitter away all day chatting with people. You don't have to wait in line at a signing table to meet authors. You can shoot them a message online. Email them. MyFace chat. You can connect for free, without having to battle the "Bring Out Your Dead" piles of flesh at the Atlanta airport or $12 hotel bar bourbon.
What projects are you working on now?
We've actually bought GoGo squeeZ a few times before. The monsters are pretty fond of it, actually. Munchkin especially likes the Apple Cinnamon flavor. I like it because it's not messy and the little pouches come with screw on tops that you can screw back on. So the kids can eat half a package and save the rest for later. Try that with one of those little tubs of applesauce with the foil lids. It's not pretty.
Let me brief you in short, although you can find Hokkien Mee elsewhere, but KL Hokkien Mee is an authentic version, which I have tried before when I was young. What is authentic Hokkien Mee? As an authentic Hokkien Mee, 1st of all, the noodles must be ‘Hokkien noodles’ which they are made without the use of preservatives, colouring and alkaline additives. Normally, these firm and smooth noodles are thicker and rounded.

#729 - ¡Que viva Mexico! (1931/1979) - (#631 on TSPDT) When one thinks Sergei Eisenstein, one probably does not automatically think of the history and culture of Mexico. Yet, here it is. Shot by Eisenstein in 1931 but never completed until 1979, thirty one years after the great Soviet director's death. Edited and finished by Eisenstein's friend and colleague Grigori Aleksandrov, this film is by far the director's most romanticized and naturalistic film - though much of this could have been Aleksandrov's touches. A fascinating piece of motion picture history that works as a look into the non-partisan side of the director (though there is a revolutionary section of the film) as well as his most pure and unadulterated cinematic work. This film can stand alongside any of the director's Soviet works of the 1920's any day.

Other important news White announced was that Frank Mir will be getting the go-ahead nod for facing JDS. Alistair Overeem was next in line for JDS but a random drug test delivered after the fight with Lesnar came back with high testosterone levels. Alistair is sticking with he withdrew from the fight due to time constraints the UFC had on marketing the event, which they couldn’t do until his hearing with the NSAC. Its was a good switch by Dana because at his hearing yesterday Overeem was denied his license to fight in Las Vegas and is unable to reapply for nine months. Thinking that this would put a damper on the UFC 146 all heavyweight card White made some major changes that would keep in tact. Cain, who was originally set to fight Mir is now facing Bigfoot Silva. Roy Nelson, who was fighting Bigfoot Silva is now fighting Gonzaga.

The conclusion is obvious, eat more fish! The health benefits of Omega-3s are significant, especially in the prevention of cardio-related deaths. The benefits far outweigh any risks from mercury, PCBs and dioxins. One of your best fish options, for the highest levels of EPA and DHA, is salmon, especially wild Yukon Keta salmon.

The entire night consists of shots, eating, shots, dancing, shots...rinse, lather, and repeat. The students don't get vodka, but rather unlimited champagne. The dancing was a lot of fun, too and I think my students were surprised to see me bust some moves on the dance floor. What was also really cool was that the parents were just as into it! They had their own circle and really never stopped dancing either! By the end of the night, I had won a dancing competition and two awards: Best Teacher Dancer and Honorable Guest! I was pretty proud of myself.

At about 3:30p we boarded the boats again and traveled to Tortuguero Village. You are given an hour and a half to explore on your own then board the boat or leave at your leisure and walk the beach back to the lodge. After this, I promise my complaining will end. Tortuguero Village exists, as it is now, for tourists. Surprise, surprise. It was like getting off a cruise ship and directed to the ‘local’ shops peddling ‘handmade’ goods really mass produced by little children somewhere. I know that’s incredibly cynical, and most-likely ignorant, but that is how I felt. I felt stared at and stereotyped. The village is beautiful, though. A thin strip of land, now an island because of a past earthquake, lush and abundant with life.

Although Munroe didn’t include ass in this survey, I’d say the same adjectives that you don’t find intensified with fucking or as shit, you also don’t find intensified with ass. A lot of the discussion on the xkcd forum focused on which adjectives could and couldn’t be intensified in these ways, but as I thought about these three obscenity-based intensifiers, it occurred to me that even one and the same adjective can’t always be intensified by all three of these intensifiers. In fact, I discovered that the rules for how to use fucking, ass, and as shit are pretty subtle.

It goes without saying that there are showbiz people out there who take up non-profit activities as a PR necessity. Clooney does not belong to that category because a) he REALLY does not need publicity and b) there are less dangerous ways of boosting one’s PR and I’m positive that going to conflict zones is not one of them. His commitment stems from genuine concern for the civilian population of Sudan who has been subjected to indiscriminate air strikes by the Sudanese central government in its fight with armed rebel groups. He spent years campaigning for Darfur, well before it took prominence in the news headlines; as matter of fact, he helped shine a light on the distressing situation there.

Anyway, I soon discovered there was quite a market for dirty music back in the day - it just wasn't played on the radio.

Once inside the building, Xu Guan took stock of his surroundings. The building did, indeed, appear to be a maintenance shed. It was filled with all manner of containers with flowers, grasses and weeds on their labels. Xu Guan could not read the English labels, but he could guess at what was inside based upon the pictures. There were numerous hand tools and a riding lawn mower like Xu Guan had seen used on the large lawns at the military bases where he had been stationed.

I was about 13 when I became really interested in religion because it all struck me as untrue.

In some situations, a product is released into a market where people are visibly frustrated and impatient that an important task they have is not getting satisfied.

The Law Society Gazette reports: ” Solicitorsfromhell.co.uk allows visitors to post complaints about law firms and individual solicitors. The postings appear on Google within 24 hours. Kordowski said that he set the website up because he was ‘shocked’ about the number of complaints made about solicitors. He maintained that he is carrying out a public service that is also of benefit to the ­profession. Law firms can pay £299 to have all current and future traces of their name removed from the site. Alternatively, they can pay between £99 and £199 to have specific postings deleted. Visitors are charged a fee for posting a complaint about a firm.” (Mr Kordowski says that visitors to the site are NOT charged a fee)
The next morning, I took off again for the ride to Ho. This was a spectacular part of the country, with small villages lining the roads and mountain vistas in the background. I had all day to get to Ho and made the most of it, stopping often to take pictures and meet people – probably important since I didn’t have a map and needed to make sure I wasn’t going to the wrong way. The highlight of this part was taking the switchbacks to cross the mountains. When I finally did get to Ho in the early afternoon, I couldn’t find the guesthouse I was looking for and got lost. Ended up taking a wrong turn and riding through the Ho market on market day, which was an intense experience. One of the reasons I didn’t want to make the first part of the journey with the rest of the guys was because I didn’t feel I had enough stop-and-go experience in the bigger cities. My trials in Ho definitely gave me that, and burned any doubts out of my system.

Detox is about healing and cleansing. It’s about learning to listen to your body (as opposed to your treacherous brain!) and care for it as were it just a defenseless baby. And if you think about it, that’s pretty much the way it is. Our bodies are under constant attack. We feed them all sorts of junk, give them too little rest and virtually no physical exercise. Then we expose them to chemicals all day long from the washing powder in our clothes, to the deodorant under our arms, the food we eat and the air we breathe. Sure, we also have a body that is designed to deal with all of this, but maybe not to the extremes it has been pushed to these days.
Thank you all for your love and support.

So let’s hope they choose a less equatorial country next week!

After the messages, the monk started chanting again and they passed around little pots of incense. From the right side of the container, you take a pinch of incense between your fingers, raise it towards your forehead, and then lower it into the little raised bit on the left side of the pot. I believe you repeat this three times. Then you clasp your hands.
In a limited sense, I am a conservative: I am quite willing to conserve what is good and I am against changing things without justification. This is, of course, a reasonable position: to infer that past idea, morals and values are incorrect simply because they are old is just as fallacious as assuming that they are correct just because they are old. The age of such things, at least by itself, has no bearing on their goodness or badness. As might be imagined, being a conservative in this sense is not what people usually think of when they think of what it is to be a conservative. After all, someone who thinks that something should be conserved on the basis of rational arguments for its goodness just seems to be, well, rational. As such, a mere willingness to conserve what is both old and good does not seem to be enough to count as a social conservative. The question is, of course, what more is needed.
When printing my contact sheets I actually printed it too light, however this was good as It showed me all details that cannot be seen when printed at the right exposure. I printed my contact sheet twice, one was too dark, one was too light. The darker one showed how much detail I had captured from the sky, and the lighter one showed me more of my model. I have edited the lighter one to get a picture in the middle of the two prints.

My understanding is that the score (as presented here) is mostly lifted from the movie itself. This does mean that there are some sound effects etc. mixed in with the music. Despite that the sound quality is pretty decent and the sound effects are minimal. Oh and there are a couple of tracks (at the end) that came from the only official release (a 45 release that came out when the movie did).

As my favorite INTP, Albert Einstein once said: “Genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration.” Ideas can only take you so far – ideas without action just hang, like an over-ripening fruit, and eventually fall to the ground, forgotten. And action can’t happen without nailing the details.
So I bought Started Early, Took My Dog, ostensibly so Rachel (a.k.a. The Bird) could read it, as she's read a couple of the other Brodie books, and I found an inexpensive first edition of Case Histories so that I could start reading the series too. But I'm not very far into it yet, and I get the feeling Atkinson deserves more than my customary one-line largely-sight-unseen plot summary (Book Glutton, I know you're an Atkinson fan, so feel free to enlighten/elaborate in the comments). So... yeah. Really, this post is even more pointless than usual.

These claims have no basis in truth, in fact they are the diametric opposite of the truth. The most generous description is they are academic fairy tales, made up to bolster a false prospectus and to support a political agenda for which the distortion of truth is essential.

Curiosity is probably going to kill this cat and I have Googled the hell out of the ‘mysteries’ over the years to find out what the secrets of the so-called oathbound mystery traditions are. This feels like an odd thing to confess to. But the crux of the matter is this: does someone need to press me on the chest, wave their magic wand and pass their power on to me? Hell no. I think I’ll keep dabbling in my own craft which is more and more starting to resemble rainbow unicorn vomit. At this stage, I’m okay with that. But in the future this may be another story.
The Belgian Saison that I brewed last Sunday is still chugging-away in it's primary fermenter. It will need at least another 4 - 6 days there, before being transferred to the secondary. The American Brown that I brewed a month ago is delicious. It turned out to be a wonderful "session" beer. The Belgian Strong Dark Ale needs to be transferred to kegs and carbonated. I'll do that this weekend. The Oak-Aged Imperial Stout also needs to be transferred and carbonated. With the IPA and Imperial IPA, that will make for 5 decent beers on tap, (six, if I include my barleywine downstairs).

Second, barring major technological breakthroughs, emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, will rise for similar reasons. The EIA projects that America’s CO2 emissions will increase by 16 percent from 2009 to 2035. (The EIA is updating its projections, but the main trends aren’t likely to change dramatically.) Stopping Canadian tar-sands development, were that possible, wouldn’t affect these emissions.

The book follows the reactions of both families. This disposition awakens in Chrissie a sense of further insecurity, one that has always existed, since he refused a divorce and never married her. In fact, although she wears a wedding ring, it is one she bought herself. She is hostile toward Margaret and Scott and doesn’t even want them to attend the funeral. She has also been left to pay taxes that she would not otherwise have been liable for, so her family will have to make do with less money.

Sadly, I suspect that another reason for this vacuum of information simply has to do with the fact that a lot of people really don't care, as long as ESL problems remain contained within ESL, they will look the other way.

The most common reason people don't like us is that they feel we're too hard on agents and publishers. Some people think we're really mean to the well-intentioned but clueless agents we warn against.

He thought about what I said. The way he does now. And came back to me saying how when he shut down it was a decision he made. He actually thought to himself I'm going to shut down. And he told me that he thinks that is progress. Instead of just doing it and feeling it he thought about it and it was a decision. Since he can make that decision now,next time he will recognize it and choose not to shut down.

However, we don’t have the time, money, or kitchen staff to pull of such an epic event. With a limited budget and only two of us cooking, we decided on a traditional family-style Victorian dinner of only four courses instead. I drew up two menus and we chose between them on the basis of time, access to ingredients, and personal taste. Here, for your edification, is the meal we decided NOT to serve. I've included the original Victorian recipe (with few extra notes for the modern cook).

Preheat oven to 350°. In a large mixing bowl beat eggs and milk. Cut bread into small cubes (about ¼ inch cubes). Three slices should make about 1 cup of bread cubes.

The title itself is probably a clue to the main ideas though. I originally translated it in my head as 'In Times of Fading Light', as I thought that sounded more natural in English than 'In Time of Diminishing Light'. However, the title actually comes from a line in the story of Nadjeshda, the old Russian mother-in-law, when she looks back at her life in Russia. She remembers the time of the potato harvest, the point of the year where the days begin to get shorter, and the amount of daylight begins to diminish. It's a wonderful metaphor for the time of greatest triumph being the start of an inevitable decline, with obvious parallels for the story as a whole.

If your child has a problem at school, which you suspect is either tale-telling or bullying, do the same. But also write what they say down in a notebook, and record the date.

Note to self: must try that at Max Brenner next time I'm there.

For Arsenal, despite recent dropped points – and to be honest, it only feels like we dropped points against Chelsea because of the Wigan result and them being so unadventurous on Saturday – their fate is in their own hands. The outcome allowed Newcastle to dare to believe and neutrals some romance, a reminder of a bygone era when a team could emerge from nowhere to be successful. That is all smoke and mirrors mixed with the tricks of time; Liverpool’s successful teams were not cheaply assembled from the council estates of Toxteth but bought in from all corners of these sceptered isles.
At the end of season 6, currently the last completed season, we have seen demons by the dozen with a variety of powers and motivations. We’ve also seen angels, gods both pagan and modern, vampires, werewolves, dragons, ghosts, ghouls, the Devil, the Christian god, and even the four horsemen. For forty-something episodes now, the fate of the world has been in the balance. Some angels want Armageddon, while others just want humans to be their playthings. Meanwhile, demons are knocking around causing their usual mischief.

So a workshop on historical fiction has the dual focus of Now, and Then, because, as I argued a few months ago, the historical novel is in some ways the ultimate novel: it embodies all the opportunities - and so difficulties - of writing fiction, but in peculiarly acute form. Between now and September I've got to sharpen my pencil (or my keyboard) and plan exercises to tackle these things: how you research... and let go of the research; how you find the voices of history... and make them come alive to the modern reader; how you make us care so passionately about your characters that we'll stay up late reading about this strange and long-ago world... and yet be all wobbly by the end because these people we've lived with aren't Now, they're Then.
And, of course, that’s NOTHING like being on a real team with real stakes and real purpose. I’m sure it’s not fun to sit in a hot dugout day after day when you don’t pitch, and it’s easy enough to duck into the clubhouse and half pay attention to it on TV, and if you’re there you might as well get some food, and if you have some food you might as well drink some beer. I get that this isn’t Little League where everyone rushes to home plate to celebrate every home run hitter, and guys yell “Hey batter batter batter” to help the pitcher out. But you are still supposed to be in it together. If I can sit through “Edelweiss,” you can sit through a few innings of baseball.

He seems a whole lot less stressed than last year, but we have to watch and make sure he doesn't get those pearly whites wrapped around anything he isn't supposed to. When he was here last summer, Sam had a little anxiety and chewed up a rug, the wood on the door frame, and a seatbelt for the car. Yeah, it was an expensive anxiety attack. We think it was because one of the boys was going off to college, so there was lots of turmoil at home before he came here. Then there were more boxes here as Col was leaving as well. Too many boxes = stress for Sammy.

Are you still with me after that warning? Soap making is a simple process that is made difficult by using lye (caustic soda). There is absolutely NO WAY to make soap from scratch without using caustic soda/ lye. If you make sure you're alone when making soap, if you have all your ingredients measured out and have a clean and clear work area, you shouldn't have any problems. The entire process should take about 30 minutes. BTW, the process of soapmaking - saponification - neutralises the lye and by the time the soap is cured, no lye remains in the soap.

This is absolutely correct. So what? Publishing through Lulu, CreateSpace, or any other middleman service that charges a fee is also vanity publishing--yet authors who use these services routinely identify themselves as self-published or (shudder) "indie," and no one challenges them. Besides, the lines between self-publishing and vanity publishing have become so blurred over the past decade or so that I'm not sure this is a meaningful distinction any longer.

menacing and distinctly no-nonsense. Scenes depicting Thor’s rampaging through SHIELD operatives whilst being sized up by Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) take on, rather than the air of overloaded franchise service, aspects of a broadening world that the characters barely yet understand, even if it all still only serves essentially to soak up screen time that could be better spent deepening the angst of its suddenly mortal and bereft hero, and giving the villain’s aims and motives clearer attention. Nonetheless, whilst Branagh doesn’t make much of the mostly by-rote action set-pieces, surprisingly for the guy who did the still startling Agincourt battle of Henry V (1989), having a director with a genuinely developed sense of dramatic nuance permeates the film in finite ways to make it look, feel, sound more solid and, consequentially and contradictorily, thus more fantastic.

I've been harbouring a little secret. Will not 'harbouring' as such. Probably more to the point of whether I should blog about it or what people might think of me. My husband left our marriage back in mid January. Now, don't so 'ohh' or have pity on me. It was a mutual decision. I've basically been single for quite a few years while we've both been living together in the house. It's been a hard slog but one that I managed quite well on my own.

“In a letter to FMCSA administrator Anne Ferro, David Parker, chairman of the MCSAC, said the agency should seek legal authority over entities that contribute to FMCSA safety violations. According to Parker, an undue detainment can cause drivers to violate hours of service rules.”

But when the markets are in a mood to think the best of a disaster, it’s amazing how much excrement you can chuck at them before they decide it tastes bad. Spain’s statistics bureau said last Friday that the country’s jobless rate rose to 24.4% in the first quarter, from 22.9% in the fourth quarter of last year; but because the recession forecast was pessimistic by 0.1%, European stocks rose.
In addition, the recipe said to only spread the graham cracker crust on the bottom of the springform pan, but for some reason I decided to pack some onto the sides of the pan too. I'm not sure why I did it but I regret it, because when I unmolded the cheesecake the sides were really ugly, craggly and uneven. (I'm not even going to include a picture of the unmolded cheesecake, I'm too embarrassed!)
Just an aside, why on earth do some parents put their children on ‘The Worlds Strictest Parents’ programme. From what I have seen it is the parents that need to be educated not their children!!!
So, we tangled and played and tried out stuff and triumphed and burned some things and messed up a few others... mostly triumphed I think. :-) On Sunday, when many in the group took turns showing off their creations, there were some amazing, heartfelt stories shared... And we also discovered a bunch of comedians hiding amongst these, mostly, normal seeming folks!
In 1993, with complaints about Father Murphy landing on his desk, Archbishop Weakland hired a social worker specializing in treating sexual offenders to evaluate him. After four days of interviews, the social worker said that Father Murphy had admitted his acts, had probably molested about 200 boys and felt no remorse.

John Ives is hiding something, but it's not the whereabouts of his daughter. It is the government-issue computers in the basement... and his past. Ronald Perkins, a former recruiter for the CIA and now Deputy Secretary for Homeland Security, knows Ives is not who he says he is, but doesn't care. Someone with an IQ of 180 and is not afraid to break the law is a valuable asset. With national security at stake, Perkins mobilizes forces to root out the perpetrators before Ives is exposed.

over and over thinking, no way can it be that easy but it was. The only problem I had was trying to protect my floors from all the spray adhesive. I need to square it up in the morning, attach the binding then make a label and call it done. The downstairs is covered in minky fuzz, lots of dusting, vacuuming and mopping will be going on after I enjoy my free day. I feel like a kid who just found out they are having a snow day off from school!!

Within this post, I just picked up the scattered stories from the media in Indonesia related to three book-bomb attact on 15 March 2011. The first news that has attracted me to publish this post was Jakarta Globe - titled "Democracy in Indonesia in 'Danger': Journalists Alliance":
So, it’s “Cumpleaños Feliz” to Gran Via. Happy Birthday. According to the ayuntamiento, the official date is the 4th of April. But after a turbulent century of ups and down, war and peace, prosperity and poverty, it’s time for a facelift.
And so onto the next section of the Tour, a section that would see us get hands on with some of the props, a place where we would meet our greatest foes, say hello to some old friends most people decided to exit throught the door, I thought I’d take the more direct route…

The second half of the film takes a Wizard of Oz turn as Gwen's servants accidentally give her twice the tranquilizer they intend to (they need her to go to sleep so they can go out to the theatre), sending Gwen into a feverish coma. There she reimagines her life as a quest narrative, interpolating the people she knows with fanciful creatures and objects. A running trope in the first half of the film had Gwen not quite understanding the metaphors grown-ups use in everyday conversation (one person is "a snake in the grass", her financier father has to "fight the bears" on Wall Street, etc) which is a funny enough joke on its own. But in the dream sequence, those metaphors take on the literality a child would see them with, such that the governess becomes an actual snake in the grass, the butler a silly jackass, the two-faced maid horrifyingly has two faces and Gwen must fight to save her father from the bears. It's clever, totally charming and the dramatic resolution with the father re-establishing his role as father first, moneymaker second (shades of Mary Poppins) is genuinely moving.
However, though unappointed, I do in fact have someplace where I can go alright. But nothing so lofty as to deem it a venue. A bolthole just about captures the nub of it. The only question, is it yet time? The answer is posted up high on the wall above the facsimile machine. It just hasn’t transmitted itself satisfactorily to me as yet. It appears to have prolapsed.

You've all seen the set I have now ... thankfully they are still in style (I think?) but I figured it might be time to make a change. Not so much because my eyes are deteriorating, but because my wardrobe is.

Like the last post, I was up this morning plugging into the world. Another piece of news caught my eye but this one is more personal. Its to do with the Band Hazing case at Florida A&M University in Tallahassee, Florida. I write this post doing duel duty: to both defend and criticize student organizations (fraternities and sororities and the like) to those that are interested, members and the resistant. And I’m doing it as a proud member of both a fraternity and a sorority.
Immediately I came up with a zillion things we can do to find ways to help us along in our writing. There's of course the easy ones: read, go on a walk, people watch, do a writing exercise, and the most obvious: write anyway, even if it's crap.
The Life Path 3 indicates that you entered this plane with a strong sense of creativity and wonderful communication skills. Achievement for you most likely comes through engaging your ingenious expression. A truly gifted 3 possesses the most exceptional innovative skills, normally in the verbal realm, writing, speaking, acting, or similar endeavors. Here we’re apt to find the entertainers of the world, bright, effervescent, sparkling people with optimistic attitudes. The bright side of this path stresses harmony, beauty, and pleasures; of sharing your inventive talents with the world. Capturing your capability in creative self-expression is the highest level of attainment for this life path.

At one point during the day, I caught an episode of Oprah on TV. That damn Oprah, she always gets to me. During this episode there was an expert that was talking about intuition. He said that humans are the only animals that ignore their intuition. We’re the only animals that explain away our common sense, ignore the feeling in our guts that says something is just not right. If a deer hears a noise in the bushes, he doesn’t run in to investigate. He goes the other way. Why don’t we, as humans, do this?

‘GCB,’ which is produced by famed ‘Sex and the City’ executive producer Darren Star, follows the lives of Christian women who carelessly live in sin and constantly find themselves caught up in salacious gossip and lies, which critics like Vallone say mock Christianity.”
This last shot was taken the evening before, so I forgot to get a setup shot. I was playing with my new softbox/speedlite set up (and my new camera body). Most I didn’t do so well on, but i liked the composition of this one.

“Radar revs the engine as to say hustle, and we are running through the parking lot, Ben's robe flowing in the wind so that he looks vaguely like a dark wizard, except that his pale skinny legs are visible, and his arms hug plastic bags.

Alright, now that all of that cheerful stuff is over and done with, I can finally get on with my very favourite pastime; bitching and moaning about the book with a smile that could gobble up the Philippines. Note: while I enjoy whining, that doesn’t mean that any of these things actually matter. I mean, me swallowing the Philippines might be a bit of a dilemma, but whatever. To get the primary things out of the way; Haunting Violet plot isn’t overly complicated, and you can see some of the plot twists coming three miles away, because they might as well be wearing giant yellow signs proclaiming “I AM A PLOT TWIST RELEVANT TO EVERY MYSTERY EVER.” Examples include: “Oh! How on earth could Rowena’s suspicious death possibly be a murder? What’s the likelihood of that, mmm, mmmm?” and “the stick up Caroline’s is not in fact that she may have murdered someone, no, it is forbidden love!” Please, gag me with a spoon.

Today’s blog comes to you from a train, as many of my blogs do. The train in question is the 13.41 service from Glasgow Queen Street to Aberdeen, my ultimate destination being the early stop of Perth. The sun’s shining, I’m listening to the debut album of folksy artist Jason Myles Goss and I’m doing my best to keep a pretty heavy stomach bug at bay.
After introductions, including from a lot of new members, we discussed what publishers consider hot currently in children's books, historical research, people's working methods, political correctness, independent booksellers and forging connections.

Christian was still as dashing as ever, dressed in a sharp black suit and tie that brought out the icy blue in his intense eyes. Women were sitting on either side of him and the ones that didn’t fit on the couch were sitting on the floor next at his feet. They were all dressed in very sexy attire, the two next to him both stroking the lapels of his suit jacket and trying to inch their way into his lap.
As I grew up, I followed my dreams and listened to my heart the way she taught me, but her absence left a hollow space inside that I couldn’t fill. I kept these thoughts to myself, turning away when tears filled my eyes and seeking seclusion in the garden when the grief became too much. When I was a little girl, Mum would sing away the nightmares and the terror that they left behind. She kept me safe and her music filled my heart and took away the darkness. As long as love filled my heart, I would be safe, she said. She just never taught me how to fill the hole her

Christine, at the prompting of her neurologist, resorts to a ploy that Mike Befeler's elderly protagonist Paul Jacobsen also uses in the geezer lit cozy RETIREMENT HOMES ARE MURDER (published 2007), keeping a journal on a daily basis. The journal becomes his memory. In Christine's case she records what she is told as well as what happens to her. So this "memory" is imperfect as well.

What I have found out is that I actually really enjoy knitting, it’s such a relaxing and almost therapeutic hobby. You can lose your mind in your own thoughts or even attempt to watch TV at the same time. I think it’s the repetitive action, it’s ever so calming. Or maybe that’s why I keep missing my stitches – I need to concentrate more!
Excerpt: (links removed)
Schumann’s ‘So wahr die Sonne scheiner,’ a Rückert setting for alto and bass duet, sounded rather lovely: modest, but heartfelt, a welcome change from the over-determination of the conducted works. ‘Tanzlied,’ for soprano and tenor, benefited from a winning lilt to the waltz and its progress; the soprano shone, but the tenor again proved a bit of a trial. Two of Schumann’s Fantasiestücke followed, given by whichever was the pianist who had not performed the piece by Clara. ‘Aufschwung’ was dextrous, though it sounded closer to Mendelssohn than to a progenitor of Brahms. The performance was not especially probing, but pleasant enough, if short-breathed; it stopped very abruptly. ‘Warum?’ exhibited a fine piano touch, though it was perhaps unduly insistent.
Disappointingly, my increasingly sore knee meant our plans for an overnight expedition to Taroko Gorge National Park never came to be. Instead, after a rest day in Hualien, we took a day trip up.

I like (a few) contemporary houses and if I were building new and didn’t care about getting my money back, I’d have one designed for me, just as I’d prefer a trimaran sailboat, if resale weren’t an issue. But often, it is and in Greenwich, contemporaries are very much passe. A search through the inventory shows 38 of them on sale (out of 738 single family houses), many of them with long-ago listing dates and none of them with a reasonable chance of getting close to their asking price (that’s my personal opinion, obviously). Greenwich buyers want traditional, for the most part, and contemporaries are not that. Peter Ogden, for instance, made quite a name for himself in Greenwich in the 60s with his designs but the few that haven’t been torn down yet sell for land value only. The poor guy’s life work won’t survive him.
This new years around July the big departmental stores in Japan are going to sell the platinum Mix free Ink.
All this, in turn, provides one answer to the question I posed at the end of last week’s post—whether it’s possible to shake our society out of its collective trance and get it to pay attention to the reality of the crisis looming up before us. Initiation is very much subject to readiness factors; the competent teacher of magic knows that at any given time, some students are ready for a given grade of initiation and others simply aren’t. Fraternal lodges such as Freemasonry cast their net more widely, but every Mason knows that a certain number of candidates for membership, however enthusiastic they think they are, will pass through the rituals unmoved and untouched, and drift out of involvement in the lodge within a few weeks or months.

If you're looking to take the abacos vacation rentals on holiday this year, have a lot of tools that will suit your needs, for example, you might instead spend at Disney parks. And you'll still be able to review these on the rodanthe vacation rentals and how the rodanthe vacation rentals will also result in less money spent on building a new course and club house with associated infrastructure and access. Add in the rodanthe vacation rentals in the rodanthe vacation rentals and around 6,500m and is the rodanthe vacation rentals next 12 months. Nearly one quarter of travelers who were surveyed had already stayed in one, and nearly one third of owners said that they had more bookings.

Furthermore, instructing Irene’s lawyer to sign a witness statement if she remained present during the questioning of the report would effectively mean that the lawyer (who would then be a “witness”) would no longer be able to represent Irene in court (should the case be taken there).

Do I think Gibson should be arrested for these comments? Not the ones he made privately, though definitely for the ones he made directly to his ex since that’s clearly abusive.

The acts could be compared to the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 or the Massacre of St Bartholomew in 1572 in terms of the the unprovoked and unexpected nature of the attacks, yet even those monstrous crimes had a political purpose beyond the glorified indulgence in carnage for its own sake. To find real equivalence we need to go further back, back to the second half of the first millennium following the birth of Christ, and it is there, again, that we find Islam.

I suppose we have long has special status here in the UK, fortunate enough to chuck whatever we wanted away into seemingly endless holes in the ground, rarely recycling and rarely setting fire to it. The terrible environmental impact of this laissez-faire attitude has put all of this to an end, we need to find new solutions and as we do so, our very British attitude to waste rises it's nimbyish head.
I have been absent lately from posting because of Blogger problems again. I was not able to sign on. It was extremely frustrating but after a lot of headaches it finally cleared up but, low and behold, when I was able to sign into my dashboard again there was a notice that the old Blogger interface will be discontinued! There are still a few other problems going on but I am not sure if it is Blogger or my computer.

How do you keep going at work when it seems as if the bottom has dropped out of your personal world? Sometimes a divorce can make even the most mundane tasks seem difficult and leading a company or running a business can seem beyond you.
“Well,” he said, “ I don’t know what is going to happen with the case I have been working for, the FDIC versus Lloyds of London. We’re trying to recover our costs from the bond, but if it is dismissed, all of our evidence will go on the public record. Go down to the clerk’s office in Springfield and get the accession number on this case.”
That’s difficult to answer because I think every book will be different and will require different investment both monetary and time. Also, one of the great things about self-publishing is that it enables you to publish a book at a very small cost.

It's for younger readers, how young I can't say. But young enough that I couldn't really get past all the boys.

Scapegoating and religion have kept close company, according to Mr. Campbell, a former editor at the Literary Review. Christianity’s central figure can be viewed as a scapegoat, taking on humanity’s sin and in the process earning a trip to Golgotha. Early believers were blamed for various disasters and accused of hideous behavior, including incest, cannibalism and child murder—accusations, Mr. Campbell adds, that Christians would later level against their own adversaries. “Ultimately our imagination is relatively limited when it comes to wickedness,” Mr. Campbell writes, “and the authorities trot out the same list of accusations towards minorities they wish to demonize.”

Now, I completely understand if you aren't a background person - but this is pure bliss to me. I love just playing around and I encourage you to give it a try. You don't always end up with a winner (as the first 3 tries of this prove...) but you might come up with something you love.

The game takes place in the eponymous world of Generica, which is plagued by the tyrannical rule of the so-called "Slayer King". The idea is simple: You must assemble a group of heroes, find the "Gladius Generica" and use it to defeat the "Slayer King". If you're the kind of person who plays JRPGs for their storyline then this game clearly isn't for you, as it does little to depart from a very specific formula. But if you're the kind of person who appreciates the mechanics of early JRPGs then you'll love this game as, in terms of its gameplay, Generica mimics an old-school JRPG as closely as I think is humanly possible.

Nearly a month ago I went through my ever busting-out closet and thought I had really done well. This was the time,……. even purses and shoes; even that black pair of slip on clog-like ones that I pull out every year for which I hate. I let them all go…joyfully! After several (meaning more than three–lots more!) black garbage bags (to hide the evidence) taken to the Goodwill drop off station, I swear if it doesn’t appear to still be too full. I have a date with that room and this time I will keep no alliances…I will never fit into those clothes again and if I do its time to be out of the ’90′s!

Judging your own beer is a tough thing to do! I normally pick my own beer apart to a point where you'd think it was undrinkable, but this one...I just really love. There are not really any faults, and I personally have had a great time watching it age and change. It hasn't really mellowed, but the coffee character and spices have changed a bit over the last year, and I'll wax a few bottles and see how they are for a few years to come.
When my mom and dad were first married, she knew nothing about house-keeping, cooking, etc. Their beginning reminds me of Loretta Lynn’s story in the movie Coal Miner’s Daughter, except my mom did not learn to play the guitar and her father was a carpenter. She did have a good voice however, and was blessed with that exceptional gift of perfect pitch. I’m sure she was influenced musically by my Grandpa, who played the fiddle and accordion – but she didn’t pursue music after the kids came along.
How liberating though to admit the things I'm just not very good at!?

But as we walked in the door, my friend was there, and her mom was right behind her. She introduced me to her mom and told her mom I was pregnant. Sure enough – her first words were, “Is this your first pregnancy?” I said "no, it’s my second. But my first baby died." I struggled to get the words out. I started crying. I’ve been rehearsing this in my mind, because I know (in most cases) I want to tell people this is my second pregnancy. But this was the first time I’ve been asked, and I wasn’t expecting it when I walked in the door. The double whammy of seeing this one year old baby girl, and being asked about my pregnancy. And my poor dh – he wasn’t expecting any of it. He doesn’t look at this girl and think of Acacia. He probably wasn’t preparing for any pregnancy questions… so after we left the party (fortunately it was quite small) he said he was exhausted. Me too. But I thought later – I wonder how it was for my friend’s mom to hear of our loss, as I remembered that she had a son who committed suicide (I don’t know old he was, high school or college age, I think). From what little I know, his death obviously shook his family deeply. On a side note – I’m curious to ask this friend (who I know her husband better than her) how she answers the question when people ask her if she has any siblings. Does she acknowledge her brother? Guess that’s more about my own obsession about how to talk about death, but I’m still curious how she handles it.
If you are going to be shrinking your final piece: whenever possible, color the full scale version, then shrink later. This helps you have the most detail and it is much easier to accurately color tiny areas if they are slightly larger.

Despite reality (real reality, not Bush, or reality TV kinds), the GOP (repugnantcan party) clings tenaciously to this fiendish canard even as we approach midnight in America. Trickle-down theory…Reaganomics.
As to an image of Mr. Sinclair, I didn't really have an actor in mind. As with Rand, I feel almost as if Sinjin defies categorization. He really is whatever appeals to the reader most. But, most people think I'm copping out when I say this (LOL) so if you want a picture, this guy looks pretty close to my idea of my vampire. Gotta love the eyes!
I made and ATE soup today.
I have no idea why this cat complains so much. He lives a life of being fed and pampered, but no, that is just somehow not enough. He wants more and he makes it known. If he had it his way…either me or my daughter would be permanently in place to feed and love him all day long. Then I think he would be truly content, though I really think the little lion would still find something to complain about.
Rumbold was cursed for a reason. This reason is discussed in detail. The curse also affects who Rumbold is as a person. Yes, the book even discusses the physical and psychological effects that being a frog may have had on the prince after he has become human again. Rumbold is a character that I immediately sympathized (*cough* fell in love *cough*) with, even as a frog. He is a charmingly awkward, yet witty young man (er, frog) with obvious personal issues. But underneath it all you know there is a dashing prince who can surely pull through. I may have found a new fairy tale crush!

Then, we wish a Merry Little Christmas, and a Happy New Year to all.
His pursuers were gaining on him. If only he could reach his TARDIS! He tripped and fell into the mud. He looked up, realising with horror that he had come to a dead end in the trench. He turned around to see his pursuers bear down on him.
The doctor notified us that he’s grown five inches since turning 5 and gained three pounds. With the way he’s heating cheese sticks these days I’m betting a few more inches are likely even a few more pounds aren’t. Cleared to return to school, off we went. With a night ballgame, this drive was the time I was going to have with the boy wonder before his birthday.
But this is an image I am willing to be stuck with. In fact, I’d much rather you think of me as the mean mama than for you to think that my child is crazy or insane! Which is why I’m OK with you thinking I am mean for not giving him a piece of cake the size of a baseball, or as many candies as he can manage to eat throughout the time at the party. I’d rather you think I’m mean now than have you thinking he’s crazy later because he’s literally bouncing off the walls and being one of the rudest, most impertinent little children you’ve ever seen. I’d rather you think I’m a mean mama because I don’t allow my little girl to run around the room full of people “harmlessly” playing tag with another little girl. Better to think me a mean mama than for you to think she’s insane as she literally looks drunk and crazy and then can’t stop herself and could even end up hurting another child later. Better to think me a mean mama…
In the month of July I am taking a "road trip" with 3 of my girlfriends and we are driving to and back from Utah. We will be gone 11 days and I am certain we will be laughing, talking, eating, stamping, laughing, talking,.....you get the idea...heehee...I used a Denami image for this card. I colored the car and friends with copics and then cut the whole image out...(darn camera sure shows I didn't do such a good job cutting...). I used pan pal chalks to try and create a scene of sorts on my round background and used some girlie dsp I had gotten from my birthday..Since I love shoes, (as much as I love glitter), I cut out a strip of shoes and used it at the bottom of the card. I used the word border to lay on top of the shoes for the girlie accent. I thought the pearls would add a little umph to the card ...anyway, for the extra part of this challenge, I plan on sending this to my AWESOME AUNT who shares the same birthday month as me. (we are 20 years apart)...and although she isn't a shut in she is one of my heros. She has raised 6 girls and has lots and lots of grand children and great grandchildren. She and my mom (sil) would road trip together to see my dad (her brother), in the nursing home towards the end of moms life. Oh the stories ....heehee...but that is for another time. I saw my sweet aunt this weekend and she raved about my cards and how much she loved them so, am going to pack this one up with a few others and send them her way to wish her Happy Birthday and let her know how much she means to me...I will also, send out a special card to one of our service members who is recovering in the hospital ....after an awful injury...along with a big thank you.
Other than gaming, what kinds of things do you enjoy doing and learning about?
Will we see the sun at last?
There is a feeling of joy, power and fullness which is steadily increasing every minute.
whisper down to the lambkid, she says:
I have been trying for ages now to bed in the habit of always carrying a water bottle - or two actually - a small one in my handbag and a bigger one in my basket. I am making a me that doesn't buy bottled water.

I'm very relieved. And we're all very excited for another little bundle of joy ... and energy, and responsibility :) to join our family. This little guy has no idea what he's in for!

I have been planning the interviews though, and already set some dates as well. I suppose some people are already out of office this week so I’m not expecting everyone to reply immediately. That’s why I also suggested some dates in May. I thought to tape the interviews on my phone but now I’m considering getting a basic digital voice recorder, e.g. this one, which can be plugged into my laptop’s USB port. For editing and transcribing the interviews I’ll probably use Audacity. It seems now that I will handle the interviews and replies anonymously but taping the interviews makes sure that I don’t miss anything important and I can listen instead of writing like a madman…
Then he focused his attention on Thomas. ‘Take your finger and examine my hands. Take your hand and stick it in my side. Don’t be unbelieving. Believe.’
